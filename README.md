| `/` | `HomePage` | Landing page with hero section |
| `/books` | `Books` | Browse all books |

## 🗃️ State Management

The app uses **React Context API** via `BookContext` to manage:

- **`readList`** — List of books marked as read
- **`wishList`** — List of books saved to wishlist
- **`handleBookReadBtn(book)`** — Adds a book to the read list
- **`handleWishListBtn(book)`** — Adds a book to the wishlist (cannot add if already in read list)

Both lists are persisted to **LocalStorage** so data survives page refreshes.
